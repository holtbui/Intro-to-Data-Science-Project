# Installation
Required libraries:

# Product Motivation
As a physical scientist attempting to reskill himself into the computer science arena, I was curious about what languages, frameworks and and databases should I learn.

One factor that drives people is money, so I wanted to see what factors determine the average salary of those skilled in computer science. The 2017 Stack Overflow survey provides a data set to gain insight to such information.

Queestions to be answered:

-What is the average salary of all users of a certain language?

-What is the average salary of all users of a certain framework?

-What is the average salary of all users of a certain database?

# File Descriptions
There is one iPython notebook to explore the dataset to ansswer the questions above.  The data set is compressed as survey_results_public.zip and is uncompressed and read by the project.ipynb.

# Results
The results of the Analysis can be found [Here]([https://www.google.com](https://medium.com/@holtbui/how-to-start-out-with-the-highest-salary-628f59e73100)https://medium.com/@holtbui/how-to-start-out-with-the-highest-salary-628f59e73100)
